# Storm-Editor Integration Specification

## Executive Summary

This document specifies the integration of Storm (LLM chat system) with the Collaborative Editor to create a unified development environment that combines real-time collaboration with AI-assisted development workflows.

**Project Goals:**
- Embed Storm's multi-LLM capabilities into collaborative document editing
- Replace primitive context management with document-aware AI assistance
- Enable teams to collaborate on AI-assisted development tasks
- Create extensible architecture for future development tools

## Current System Analysis

### Storm System (Go-based)
- **Core**: Multi-LLM chat interface with query/response/references/reasoning structure
- **Storage**: BBolt key-value database for persistence
- **Context**: Limited to "last 300k characters" of conversation history
- **LLMs**: Supports multiple providers (sonar-deep-research, sonar-reasoning, o3-mini)
- **I/O**: File input/output capabilities for LLM operations
- **Parsing**: RoundTrip structure parsing via storm/split package

### Collaborative Editor (Rust/JS-based)
- **Core**: Real-time collaborative editing with rich formatting
- **Persistence**: Currently Yjs-based (being rewritten)
- **WASM**: Rust-powered text processing and formatting
- **Messaging**: PromiseGrid CBOR protocol integration
- **UI**: Professional document interface with markdown preview
- **Export**: Multiple format support (CBOR, PromiseGrid, JSON)

## Integration Architecture

### Phase 1: Hybrid Integration (Recommended Start)

#### Core Components
1. **Storm Backend** (Go + BBolt) - Proven LLM integration
2. **Enhanced Collaborative Editor** - Extended to understand RoundTrip format
3. **PromiseGrid Coordination** - Multi-instance synchronization
4. **Document Context Engine** - Replace 300k char limit with structured indexing

#### Data Flow
```
User Query → Collaborative Document → Storm Backend → LLM Provider
    ↓                ↓                     ↓
Document History → Context Engine → Vector Index → AI Response
    ↓                ↓                     ↓
PromiseGrid → Other Users → Collaborative Review → Document Update
```

### Phase 2: Unified Architecture

#### Long-term Vision
- **Single Codebase**: Migrate Rust components to Go or Go components to Rust
- **Vector Database**: Replace BBolt with semantic search capabilities
- **Real-time AI**: Context-aware suggestions as users type
- **Distributed Collaboration**: PromiseGrid-based peer-to-peer architecture

## Technical Considerations

### 1. Context Management Strategy

**Current Problem**: Storm's "last 300k characters" is primitive and lossy

**Proposed Solution**: Document-Aware Context Engine
- **Real-time Indexing**: Index document content as users edit
- **Semantic Relationships**: Track cross-document references and links
- **Edit History**: Maintain context of how documents evolved
- **User Patterns**: Learn from collaboration patterns and preferences

**Implementation Options**:
- **BBolt Enhancement**: Extend current key-value store with structured indexing
- **Vector Database**: Migrate to purpose-built semantic search (ChromaDB, Weaviate)
- **Hybrid Approach**: BBolt for metadata, vector DB for content search

### 2. Collaborative AI Workflow

**User Choice Architecture**:
- **Per-Document LLM Selection**: Teams can choose different LLMs for different projects
- **Context Scope Control**: Users select what content AI can access
- **Response Approval Workflow**: AI suggestions require collaborative review
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle simultaneous human/AI edits gracefully

**RoundTrip Integration**:
- Map Storm's Query→Response→References→Reasoning to document sections
- References become live links between documents
- Reasoning can be hidden metadata or visible annotations
- Multiple users can collaborate on refining queries and reviewing responses

### 3. PromiseGrid Protocol Role

**Message Types**:
- **Edit Operations**: Real-time collaborative editing (potential Yjs replacement)
- **AI Queries**: Distributed LLM request coordination
- **Context Sharing**: Semantic index synchronization between instances
- **Response Distribution**: AI output broadcast to collaborators

**Network Architecture**:
- **Peer-to-Peer**: Direct collaboration without central server
- **Hybrid**: Local instances with optional coordination server
- **Federated**: Multiple organizations sharing development contexts

### 4. Data Security and Privacy

**Sensitive Context Management**:
- **Local Processing**: Keep sensitive documents on local instances
- **Selective Sharing**: Users control what content is AI-accessible
- **Audit Trails**: Track all AI interactions for compliance
- **Encryption**: PromiseGrid messages encrypted in transit

**LLM Provider Considerations**:
- **Data Residency**: Route queries to appropriate regional providers
- **Content Filtering**: Prevent sensitive data from reaching external LLMs
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor and limit AI provider costs

## Key Decisions and Tradeoffs

### 1. Language Unification
**Decision Point**: Keep Go/Rust hybrid or unify to single language?

**Options**:
- **Keep Hybrid**: Leverage existing strengths, accept complexity
- **Migrate to Go**: Unify around Storm's proven LLM integration
- **Migrate to Rust**: Unify around editor's performance and safety

**Recommendation**: Start hybrid, evaluate unification in Phase 3

### 2. Yjs Replacement Strategy
**Decision Point**: What replaces Yjs for real-time collaboration?

**Options**:
- **PromiseGrid Native**: Use CBOR messages for all collaborative operations
- **Custom CRDT**: Build domain-specific conflict-free data structures
- **Hybrid Approach**: PromiseGrid coordination + local conflict resolution

**Recommendation**: PromiseGrid native for consistency with overall architecture

### 3. Vector Database Integration
**Decision Point**: When and how to add semantic search?

**Options**:
- **Immediate**: Start with vector DB from Phase 1
- **Gradual**: Enhance BBolt first, migrate later
- **Optional**: Make vector search a plug-in capability

**Recommendation**: Gradual approach to minimize risk

### 4. AI Provider Strategy
**Decision Point**: How to handle multiple LLM providers?

**Options**:
- **Storm Native**: Extend Storm's existing provider abstraction
- **Plugin Architecture**: Allow third-party LLM integrations
- **Marketplace Model**: Certified provider ecosystem

**Recommendation**: Extend Storm's proven approach, add plugin capability later
