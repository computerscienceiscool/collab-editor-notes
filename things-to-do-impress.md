# Things to Do

## 1. Complete the High-Impact Action Items Quickly

- Add the missing version numbers for Rust and WASM pack to `installation.md` (you started this already)
- Implement the keyboard shortcuts opt-in feature (Steve and the team agreed this was important)
- Focus on the Promise Grid integration work - this is clearly a priority for Steve

## 2. Show Initiative on Learning

**Steve specifically praised your learning**: "I'm glad that she's taking the time to learn all that stuff about all of the JavaScript libraries... Because I just haven't had the time to be able to do that."

- Continue documenting what you learn - your documentation was mentioned positively multiple times
- Your Playwright testing work impressed the team - build on that

## 3. Execute on the Technical Roadmap

Steve outlined these priorities for you:

- Work on Promise Grid messages to sync IndexedDB between browsers
- Eventually remove YJS dependency and replace with Promise Grid messaging
- Refactor to use Promise Grid's KV store instead of IndexedDB directly

## 4. Demonstrate Progress Through Iterations

- Steve emphasized: "think in terms of everything being proof of concept, throwaway code"
- Don't get stuck trying to make things perfect - show steady progress
- He specifically warned against "trying to make each piece of your art perfect rather than getting it done"

## Key Insights from Steve's Feedback

### What Steve Values:
- Your willingness to learn complex JavaScript libraries he doesn't have time for
- Your thorough documentation (he mentioned it multiple times positively)
- Your iterative approach and getting things working even if not perfect
- Your Playwright testing work

### What to Avoid:
- Don't get stuck trying to make things perfect ("80% of my bugs are keyboard shortcuts" - but keep moving)
- Don't worry too much about whether you're going in the wrong direction - "None of us know exactly how this is all going to turn out"

### Quote to Remember:
