# Tombstone Tools Specification

## Overview

This specification outlines a comprehensive approach to tracking and managing deleted content (tombstones) in collaborative document editing systems built on CRDT technology. The goal is to provide complete audit trails and data recovery capabilities while maintaining real-time collaboration performance.

## Problem Statement

Modern collaborative editors using CRDTs preserve deleted content as "tombstones" for conflict resolution, but this information is typically hidden from users. Organizations with strict compliance requirements need visibility into all document changes, including deletions, for audit trails and data recovery purposes.

## Core Requirements

### Data Integrity
- All document changes must be permanently recorded
- Deleted content must remain accessible for forensic analysis
- Change attribution must include user identification and timestamps
- No data loss scenarios, even with large-scale deletions

### Compliance Support
- Full audit trail generation for regulatory requirements
- Document state reconstruction at any point in time
- Non-repudiation of document changes
- Exportable compliance reports

### Performance Considerations
- Minimal impact on real-time collaboration
- Scalable to documents with extensive edit histories
- Optional activation to avoid unnecessary overhead

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Tombstone Viewer Interface

**Purpose**: Administrative interface for viewing deleted content and change history

**Key Features**:
- Timeline view of all document modifications
- Deleted content visualization with context
- User attribution for each change
- Filtering capabilities by date range, user, or change type
- Side-by-side comparison of document states

**Access Control**:
- Role-based permissions for tombstone access
- Document-level security controls
- Audit logging of tombstone viewer usage

### 2. Document Mode System

**Purpose**: Differentiated handling based on compliance requirements

**Implementation Approach**:
- Standard Mode: Normal collaborative editing with hidden tombstones
- Audit Mode: Enhanced tracking with tombstone preservation and accessibility
- Hybrid Mode: Real-time collaboration with periodic audit snapshots

**Mode Selection Criteria**:
- Document sensitivity classification
- Organizational compliance requirements
- User role and permissions
- Document lifecycle stage

### 3. Audit Export Functionality

**Purpose**: Generate comprehensive reports for compliance and legal requirements

**Export Formats**:
- PDF reports with change summaries and metadata
- CSV files for data analysis and integration
- JSON exports for programmatic processing
- Timestamped archive formats for long-term storage

**Report Contents**:
- Complete change chronology
- User activity summaries
- Deleted content with recovery information
- Document state snapshots at key intervals
- Compliance metadata and signatures

## Technical Architecture

### Data Layer
- Enhanced tombstone storage with metadata enrichment
- Efficient indexing for historical content retrieval
- Compression strategies for long-term storage
- Integration with existing CRDT synchronization

### Application Layer
- Plugin architecture for audit tool integration
- Configurable retention policies
- Background processing for report generation
- Real-time change event streaming

### Security Layer
- Encrypted storage for sensitive tombstone data
- Access control integration with existing authentication
- Audit logging of all tombstone-related operations
- Data anonymization options for privacy compliance

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Basic tombstone extraction and storage
- Simple administrative viewer interface
- Core export functionality for essential reports

### Phase 2: Enhancement
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Document mode system implementation
- Integration with compliance frameworks

### Phase 3: Optimization
- Performance tuning for large document histories
- Advanced visualization and analytics
- Enterprise-grade security and access controls

## Success Metrics

### Functional Metrics
- Complete audit trail coverage (100% of document changes)
- Report generation time under acceptable thresholds
- Zero data loss incidents during normal operations

### Performance Metrics
- Minimal impact on real-time collaboration responsiveness
- Efficient storage utilization for tombstone data
- Scalable performance with document size and user count

### Compliance Metrics
- Successful regulatory audit completions
- Reduced time for compliance report generation
- Enhanced data governance capabilities

## Risk Considerations

### Technical Risks
- Performance degradation with extensive tombstone histories
- Storage scalability challenges
- Integration complexity with existing systems

### Operational Risks
- User training requirements for new audit interfaces
- Data privacy implications of enhanced tracking
- Backup and recovery procedure modifications

### Mitigation Strategies
- Phased rollout with performance monitoring
- Comprehensive testing with realistic data volumes
- Clear documentation and training materials
- Privacy impact assessments and controls

## Conclusion

This tombstone tracking solution provides a comprehensive approach to audit trail requirements while preserving the collaborative editing experience. The modular design allows for flexible implementation based on organizational needs and compliance requirements.
