Settings Update After Commit
* Saving commit preferences
* Updating last commit information
Additional Testing
* Dialog interaction and UX
* Accessibility features
* Edge cases and error handling
* Special characters and long paths
Test Structure:
The file follows the existing test patterns from your codebase:
* Uses CollabEditorHelpers for consistent test utilities
* Implements proper mocking for GitHub services
* Includes skip conditions for when GitHub integration isn't available
* Provides comprehensive error scenarios and edge case testing
Mock Strategy:
The tests mock the GitHub service methods to avoid actual API calls while still testing the complete user flow and UI interactions. The mocks store test data for verification and simulate various success/failure scenarios.
The file is ready to run with your existing Playwright test setup and will provide comprehensive coverage of the GitHub commit functionality as it gets implemented in your application.

Test Structure:
The file follows the same patterns as the commit test:
* Uses CollabEditorHelpers for consistent test utilities
* Implements comprehensive mocking for GitHub services with various file scenarios
* Includes skip conditions for when GitHub integration isn't available
* Provides extensive error scenarios and edge case testing
Mock Strategy:
The tests include a sophisticated mock system that simulates:
* Multiple repositories with different file structures
* Various file types (markdown, empty files, unicode content, large files)
* Different error conditions (missing files, access denied, network errors)
* Realistic API delays and responses
The file provides comprehensive coverage of the GitHub pull functionality and is ready to run with your existing Playwright test setup.
1. Complete workflows (setup ? commit ? pull)
* Status: Fully implemented
* The 'setup ? commit ? pull workflow' test is comprehensive, covering: 
o GitHub configuration verification
o Content creation and commit execution
o Content modification and pull-back verification
o Full roundtrip data integrity checking
o Integration data validation
2. Multi-user collaboration with co-authors
* Status: Fully implemented
* Three comprehensive tests: 
o 'detects and includes multiple collaborators' - Tests detection of 4+ collaborators
o 'handles dynamic collaborator changes' - Tests real-time collaborator updates
o 'handles edge cases in collaboration detection' - Tests invalid user data handling
3. Security testing
* Status: Fully implemented
* Four thorough security tests: 
o 'prevents XSS in commit messages' - Tests multiple XSS vectors
o 'sanitizes file paths and prevents directory traversal' - Tests path injection
o 'prevents XSS in file content' - Tests content-based XSS
o 'validates user input and prevents injection' - Tests user name injection
4. Performance with large documents
* Status: Fully implemented
* Four comprehensive performance tests: 
o 'handles large document commits efficiently' - Tests 100K+ character documents
o 'handles large document pulls efficiently' - Tests large file retrieval
o 'maintains responsiveness during large operations' - Tests UI responsiveness
o 'handles memory efficiently with multiple large operations' - Tests memory usage
Area 5: Menu Integration
* Tests that GitHub menu items are properly added to File and Tools menus
* Verifies menu actions work correctly (commit, pull, settings)
* Tests behavior with unconfigured GitHub
* Ensures menu integration survives page navigation
* Tracks menu interactions for analysis
Area 6: Keyboard Shortcuts
* Tests Ctrl+Alt+G for GitHub commit dialog
* Tests Ctrl+Alt+Shift+G for GitHub settings dialog
* Verifies shortcuts work with open modals and different browser contexts
* Tests integration with the shortcut manager system
* Includes customization and performance testing
* Handles browser-specific key combinations (Meta vs Control)
Area 7: Error Recovery Scenarios
* Network failure recovery during commits
* Invalid token scenario handling
* Repository access error recovery
* Malformed settings data recovery
* Dialog state corruption recovery
* Simultaneous operation conflict resolution
* Data integrity maintenance during errors
* Helpful error messages for common issues
* Comprehensive error boundary testing
* Graceful degradation when GitHub service is unavailable
The file follows the same structure and patterns as the first test file, with comprehensive mocking, detailed logging, performance tracking, and integration data collection. Each test includes proper setup/teardown, error handling, and verification of both functionality and data integrity.
The tests are designed to work with the existing GitHub integration architecture while providing thorough coverage of menu systems, keyboard shortcuts, and error recovery scenarios that are critical for a robust GitHub integration.
