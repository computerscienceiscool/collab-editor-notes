Why File Systems Matter in Linux

Linux stands out because it supports many file systems, each optimized for different purposes. Examples:
- ext4 – The default on most Linux systems; stable and fast.
- XFS – Great for handling very large files or parallel I/O.
- Btrfs – Supports snapshots, checksums, and advanced volume management.
- ZFS – Designed for data integrity, with built-in compression and RAID.
- tmpfs – Stores files in RAM for very fast, temporary storage.
- F2FS – Optimized for flash memory and SSDs.

This flexibility means Linux can run efficiently on devices ranging from microcontrollers to supercomputers.
